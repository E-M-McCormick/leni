Description: Collection of tools for Linear Estimation with Nonlinear Inference (LENI) which involves
	estimating the parameters of nonlinear target functions as transformations of linear models. 
	Includes support for regression and mixed-effects models (main function: leni()) which produces 
	transformed parameter estimates, as well as structural equation models (main function: leni_sem()) 
	which generates 'lavaan' syntax for fitting linearized SEMs.
